<p>If you want to go the extra mile, you can make animated skins for H3VR as well. Before I explain how:</p>
<p>You'll be needing Unity in addition to what you currently have.</p>
<p>Oh, and Skinpacker won't work from this point on, sorry! You're going to need a ZIP Program!</p>
<p><a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive">Unity 5.6.3f1</a> is the version I used (Unity 5.x category).</p>
<p>You'll also need a template for H3VR stuffs, here is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRHZrJxgPmE1PJGR_ty3i78mBfLTZQiB/view?usp=sharing">one from PhoenixCraft99</a>.</p>
<p>Once you get these up and running, move on to the first step:</p>
<h2 id="step-1---enabling-emissions-for-substance-painter">Step 1 - Enabling Emissions for Substance Painter</h2>
<p>At this point it is recommended for you to be using Substance Painter, so that the tutorial can be easily understood and things move smoothly.</p>
<p>On Substance Painter, you should have your canvas open with the usual instructions (New Canvas with Normal Texture, Bake Maps, Include Normal post-bake)</p>
<p>There is one addition to this process for when you want to make animated skins.</p>
<p>Over on these texture set settings, click on the plus sign next to &quot;Channels</p>
<p><img src="images/sp_1.png" alt="sp 1"></p>
<p>Select &quot;Emissive&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/sp_2.png" alt="sp 2"></p>
<p>Your result should look like this. With this, you have enabled Emissives for Substance Painter. Now, what to do with that...</p>
<p><img src="images/sp_3.png" alt="sp 3"></p>
<h2 id="step-2---applying-emissions-automatic-vs-custom">Step 2 - Applying Emissions (Automatic vs. Custom)</h2>
<p>Now, there are two ways you can add Emissions to your canvas.</p>
<p>The easier way is through Materials and Smart Materials, the <strong>Automatic</strong> choice.</p>
<p>Some SMs and Materials come with emissions included in them. (There is a starter pack with SMs and Materials included in Extras!)</p>
<p>Drag n Drop. Boom. Done. Easy.</p>
<p>However, if you have a bit more in mind, you can make your own <strong>Custom</strong> Emissives.</p>
<p>First, make a new layer dedicated to these emissions.</p>
<p><img src="images/emiss_1.png" alt="emmis 1"></p>
<p>Using the advanced tricks above, stamps and the material settings become handy. Notice the &quot;emiss&quot; selection? That's new, and that's what we'll need. Enable that, and if you want your stamp exclusively for the animated skin part, disable everything else,</p>
<p><img src="images/emiss_2.png" alt="emiss 2"></p>
<p>After doing this, painting anything now will be included in an Emission category, and the Alloy export you're used to will not detect these emissions.</p>
<p><img src="images/emiss_3.png" alt="emiss 3"></p>
<h2 id="step-3---exporting-twice">Step 3 - Exporting... Twice!</h2>
<p>After you make a skin, you need to export it a bit differently, too. You'll need to export twice.</p>
<p>Once with the <strong>Alloy</strong> Preset.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_1.png" alt="export 1"></p>
<p>Then the next being with preset Document Channels.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_2.png" alt="export 2"></p>
<p>I recommend having these exports in separate locations. My Alloy was sent here, but my second export I placed in the &quot;emiss&quot; folder. Don't you like having things organized? Me too.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_3.png" alt="export 3"></p>
<p>Visiting said folder, this is what the export looks like. The only one we're interested in is our emission export, in which this example is called &quot;None_Emissive&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_4.png" alt="export 4"></p>
<p>I recommend renaming it to emiss before moving it with the alloy export. That's how you make an Emission! Now, the next part...</p>
<p><img src="images/export_5.png" alt="export 5"></p>
<h2 id="step-4---incandescence-the-map-of-animation">Step 4 - Incandescence, the map of Animation</h2>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The starter pack will include a bundle of Incandescence PNGs, so you can skip this part if you already have one that works with your skin.</p>
</div>
<p>To bring these emissions to light, you need a fifth png. A black and white png that scrolls through the Emissive texture in variating opacities, giving it that &quot;animated&quot; effect.</p>
<p>To make it, you could even use Microsoft Paint! But for this example, we'll be using Photoshop.</p>
<p>For most Incandescence Maps, they are 512 x 512, a fourth of the size of the exports.</p>
<p><img src="images/incan_1.png" alt="incan 1"></p>
<p>Start off with a black background, and make a picture of how you want your emissions revealed, then make that effect on here.</p>
<p><img src="images/incan_2.png" alt="incan 2"></p>
<p>This is my example of an incandescence map, yours can be different, but so long as it follows the same rules (black and white, 512 x 512) it should work.</p>
<p><img src="images/incan_3.png" alt="incan 3"></p>
<p>(If your canvas has a map that translates well, you could make a 2048 x 2048 map with variating Incandescence maps. However, this might not work for all canvases)</p>
<p>Save it as &quot;incan.png&quot; with the other four exports. Now that we have the last piece, we can move on to Unity!</p>
<h2 id="step-5---unity-and-what-to-do-with-it">Step 5 - Unity, and what to do with it.</h2>
<p>So, you should have Unity 5.6.3 installed by now, right?</p>
<p>If this is your first time using it, do not panic, you'll only be needing it for two minutes, honestly.</p>
<p>That being said, lemme state a few rules to this process that I've discovered the hard way:</p>
<p><strong>Rule 1)</strong> Every animated skin you make, you need to make a new material for it. You CANNOT use the same material for two skins.</p>
<p>Using the same material on two skins will result in one skin being an abhorrent mess of the other skin's textures.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2)</strong> Every Material you make, you need to include new, unused PNGs for it. You CANNOT use the same PNGs for two skins.</p>
<p>This mainly applies to Incandescence Maps. We'll be talking about scroll speeds soon, but if you use the same incan.png, than there will be only one speed, not two.</p>
<p>Lets get started.</p>
<p>Opening Unity should result in something like this. Lets begin by making a subfolder in this main folder, &quot;Assets&quot;, and I'll call this subfolder, &quot;am&quot; (for Animated Material)</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_1.png" alt="unity 1"></p>
<p>In this subfolder &quot;am&quot;, I'm going to make another folder based off of the skin I'm making. This subfolder will have my PNG exports.</p>
<p>The quick way would be to drag and drop your pngs in this category, but if you plan on making multiple animated skins, this will get clutter-some real quick.</p>
<p>Instead, make a copy of your exports, put them somewhere else, than add a codename to them.</p>
<p>After you give them a codename, import those pngs into the dedicated folder under <strong>Assets --&gt; am</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_2.png" alt="unity 2"></p>
<p>Yeah, making multiple animated skins, this is what it'll look like in the long run. Anyway...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_3.png" alt="unity 3"></p>
<p>So now that we have those pngs on Unity, go back to <strong>Assets</strong>...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_4.png" alt="unity 4"></p>
<p>Here is where I store my Animated Materials, and there is a reason behind it that we'll get to in the hotmodding step, but for now, follow my example.</p>
<p>Right click, and choose &quot;Create&quot;</p>
<p>A bunch of options will pop up, but we'll be looking for &quot;Material&quot;</p>
<p>A new material made, you're now going to want to look to the right.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_5.png" alt="unity 5"></p>
<p>The Shader set to &quot;Standard&quot; needs to be changed into &quot;Alloy/Core&quot;. Left click the shader...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_6.png" alt="unity 6"></p>
<p>And locate the category &quot;Alloy&quot;. Down this collection, look for &quot;Core&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_7.png" alt="unity 7"></p>
<p>Your information should now change to something far more simple than prior. Phew! Nothing too crazy here!</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_8.png" alt="unity 8"></p>
<p>Before we crack it open, we will need to add one more thing though. Look for the &quot;plus&quot; symbol next to the &quot;Add Tab&quot; category...</p>
<p>And select &quot;<strong>Emission</strong>&quot; to the categories.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_9.png" alt="unity 9"></p>
<p>Your result should be like this. Now, one more thing, there is a tint to this Emission category...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_10.png" alt="unity 10"></p>
<p>Bump that up to its max, at all white, for the full effect.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_11.png" alt="unity 11"></p>
<p>Alright! This material is ready to go!</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_12.png" alt="unity 12"></p>
<p>Now, it's not gonna be called &quot;new material&quot; forever, but this next step is important.</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>The name you give your material will be needed for the hotmodding step, so keep it simple!</p>
</div>
<p>Lowercase, underscores, and keep it small. All my animated materials start with &quot;tdam_&quot; but yours can be different.</p>
<p>For this example, my material is called &quot;tdam_puppet&quot;.</p>
<p>The only categories we'll be focused on in &quot;Main Textures&quot; and &quot;Emission&quot;, these are where those PNG exports will go</p>
<p>Right next to the empty spaces are tiny circles, select them...</p>
<p>A popup should appear. (This is where the codenames come in handy, use the search bar to aid you)</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_13.png" alt="unity 13"></p>
<p>Find the select pngs that go with each category. Base Color needs base color.png, Metal needs alloy.png, Normal needs normal.png--</p>
<p>Holup</p>
<p>When you apply the normal map, a prompt saying &quot;fix now&quot; appears. Tap that and we will continue</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_14.png" alt="unity 14"></p>
<p>Now, to the Emissive.</p>
<p>Mask needs emiss.png, and Effect needs incan.png--</p>
<p>STOP</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_15.png" alt="unity 15"></p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_16.png" alt="unity 16"></p>
<p>There is more to that Incandescence Map. Mainly, the scroll effect.</p>
<p>X and Y, X is horizontal scroll, and Y is vertical</p>
<p>X --&gt; -numbers go left, +numbers go right</p>
<p>Y --&gt; -numbers go down, +numbers go up</p>
<p>My example is .12 but yours can be anything else (within the limits between 0 and 1/-1)</p>
<p>If you forget this, your skin won't be animated, so don't forget!</p>
<p>Now that you have your pngs inside this material, lets address the elephant in the room.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_17.png" alt="unity 17"></p>
<p>Asset Bundles. &quot;None&quot; needs to go. You'll be renaming it to something else, and that name does matter, so I HIGHLY recommend you use the same name as your material.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_18.png" alt="unity 18"></p>
<p>Select &quot;New...&quot;, then name it as you will, but I'll be naming mine the same as the material.</p>
<p>Visit your pngs and include them in the same bundle as the one you made.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_19.png" alt="unity 19"></p>
<p>Lastly, there is something included with your template. The Core shader. That needs to be included as well, elsewise...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_20.png" alt="unity 20"></p>
<p>This happens.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_oof.jpg" alt="unity oof"></p>
<p>So be sure you have included for every skin you make!</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_21.png" alt="unity 21"></p>
<p>Up above look for &quot;Window&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_22.png" alt="unity 22"></p>
<p>A lot of options come up, but you're going to be selecting &quot;<strong>AssetBundle Browser</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_23.png" alt="unity 23"></p>
<p>A new pop up will appear. Yours won't have as many categories, but the one we're focused on is the current bundle, which we named the same as our material, right?</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_24.png" alt="unity 24"></p>
<p>A good time to check to see if you have everything. Seven things: Material, Shader, and the five PNGs you have.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_25.png" alt="unity 25"></p>
<p>If you have these seven things, move on to the &quot;<strong>Build</strong>&quot; option.</p>
<p>Now, this is the Unity Export. The result will be a file that will be used for the hotmod, and this file will enable animated skins for that weapon.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_26.png" alt="unity 26"></p>
<p>That being said, another recommendation, make a folder called &quot;mat&quot; where you have your textures located.</p>
<p>Make this the place where you export. Back on Unity, browse and locate this &quot;mat&quot; folder, then build it.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_27.png" alt="unity 27"></p>
<p>It takes my computer a half a minute, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Once built, you are all done!</p>
<p>Now... The hotmodding..</p>
<h2 id="step-6---hotmod-the-results">Step 6 - Hotmod the results</h2>
<p>(An example manifest and a manifest template will be included in the starter pack!)</p>
<p>In you &quot;mat&quot; folder, bring out the file built by Unity.</p>
<p>Homestretch. Five PNGs, one &quot;Material&quot; file... Now we need a manifest.</p>
<p><img src="images/hotmod/hotmod_1.png" alt="hotmod 1"></p>
<p>Open SkinPacker, and locate this location, and have it generate a manifest for you.</p>
<p>guid - &quot;a&quot;</p>
<p>name - &quot;a&quot;</p>
<p>version - &quot;1.0.0&quot;</p>
<p>save manifest</p>
<p>Why the low effort? Unfortunately, I have some bad news.</p>
<p>You cannot use SkinPacker here...</p>
<p>Skinpacker only works with Textures. It kicks the can when you include anything else.</p>
<p>So, after saving the manifest, close SkinPacker.</p>
<p>We're gonna get hands on now...</p>
<p>Open the Manifest.</p>
<p>It should look something like this, right?</p>
<p><img src="images/hotmod/hotmod_2.png" alt="hotmod 2"></p>
<p>Here's an incoming wall of text that you'll be copying and replacing these details, because, good news!</p>
<p>The format of making animated skins this way is near identical to one another!</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
  &quot;manifestRevision&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
  &quot;guid&quot;: &quot;[name]&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;[Name]&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;[Description]&quot;,
  &quot;assetMappings&quot;: [
   {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Material&quot;,
      &quot;target&quot;: &quot;h3vr_data\\streamingassets\\assets_resources_objectids_weaponry_[category]\\[gun]:[gun mat]&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;[bundle name]:assets\\[mat name].mat&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Texture&quot;,
      &quot;target&quot;: &quot;:[mat name]::_MainTex&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;base color.png&quot;
    },
    {

      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Texture&quot;,
      &quot;target&quot;: &quot;:[mat name]::_SpecTex&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;alloy.png&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Texture&quot;,
      &quot;target&quot;: &quot;:[mat name]::_BumpMap&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;normal.png&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Texture&quot;,
      &quot;target&quot;: &quot;:[mat name]::_EmissionMap&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;emiss.png&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Texture&quot;,
      &quot;target&quot;: &quot;:[mat name]::_IncandescenceMap&quot;,
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;incan.png&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Copy that json for your manifest.</p>
<p>Now that it's like this, lets break it down.</p>
<p><img src="images/hotmod/hotmod_4.png" alt="hotmod 4"></p>
<p>Guid --&gt; Sideloader ID, needs to be lowercase and with either underscores or periods, no spaces</p>
<p>Name &amp; Description --&gt; self-explanatory</p>
<p>Target is very important, the trickiest part of this process... this is the prefab path and material name of the gun you are making a skin for.</p>
<p>To assist, use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mjeo410-2wgou9JHSb_I1VltNTyzNXZX_EwhMNsfH6Y/edit#gid=1966002968">this spreadsheet</a> made by Ghorsington.</p>
<p>But for my example, I am making a skin for the Uzi, so my target would be</p>
<p><img src="images/hotmod/hotmod_4_5.png" alt="hotmod 4 5"></p>
<p><strong>Category</strong> becomes &quot;Smgs&quot; , <strong>Gun</strong> becomes uzi, and <strong>gun mat</strong> becomes IMIUZI_GUN</p>
<p><img src="images/hotmod/hotmod_5.png" alt="hotmod 5"></p>
<p>Target's down, next is path.</p>
<p>If you named your asset bundle and material name the same, and have your material in the assets folder just as this tutorial instructed, then this is going to be a sinch!</p>
<p>However, if you stored your material in a subfolder of &quot;Assets&quot;, it's gonna be a bit more tricky</p>
<p><code>[bundle name]:assets\\[mat name].mat</code> --&gt; <code>[bundle name]:assets\\[subfolder]\\[mat name].mat</code></p>
<p>This is why I keep it in assets because it makes it less confusing!</p>
<p>ANYWAY</p>
<p>The name you used on both is what <strong>bundle name</strong> and <strong>mat name</strong> becomes!</p>
<p>My example is &quot;tdam_puppet&quot;, so I replace it all [] portions with tdam_puppet.</p>
<p>Here is the final product of my example, yours should hopefully follow the same pattern!</p>
<p><img src="images/hotmod/hotmod_6.png" alt="hotmod 6"></p>
<p>Save the manifest and exit out.</p>
<p>The final step of the final step is to manually make a hotmod.</p>
<p>Select all seven items in your folder, the five textures, the manifest, and the unity file we dubbed as the &quot;material&quot; file.</p>
<p><img src="images/hotmod/hotmod_7.png" alt="hotmod 7"></p>
<p>Use a ZIP program [WINRAR, Bandizip, etc] to package all the materials into a ZIP.</p>
<p>Rename the .zip to .hotmod or .h3mod</p>
